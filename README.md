## FAQ

##### Why is the mod named Ghost Translations?
I originally named it this because the Stranger's Inhabitants were called Ghostbirds in the files. I realize now it isn't the best name but I'm not gonna bother changing it lol.

##### Did you just make stuff up?
I made the translations myself with the data collected from ship log.
Since the only text from this language is on location signs it was easy to just pull the names from the Ship Log, and the keep out signs were pretty obvious.

##### Does this works on modded wall texts?
No. Unless I add support it won't work and will just show "Untranslatable" instead.

##### Shouldn't it be Owlk/Owelk and not Inhabitants?
Well that is just a fan name. I originally had it as Owelk but I changed it to Inhabitants since that is more fitting.
